# Sentiment Analysis Comparative Evaluation

Sentiment analysis on social media platforms is crucial for understanding public opinion. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of word embedding techniques for sentiment analysis. The choice of the Twitter dataset serves as a representative sample of social media data commonly used in sentiment analysis research. However, the methodologies and findings presented in this study are applicable to sentiment analysis tasks across diverse datasets, not limited to Twitter. 

The performance of Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Doc2Vec, and BERT embeddings are analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. BERT emerges as the top performer in terms of accuracy. The paper concludes with insights into future research directions, including integrating multiple modalities and adapting models for dynamic language trends.

## Methodology

In our study, we ensured consistency across all experimental conditions by maintaining uniformity in the dataset, preprocessing steps, and model configurations. This approach facilitated a fair and direct comparison of the performance of different word embedding techniques. By keeping all aspects of the data preprocessing and model setup consistent, except for the choice of embedding technique, we aimed to isolate the impact of each embedding method on sentiment analysis outcomes. 

This rigorous methodology enabled us to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Doc2Vec, and BERT embeddings in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This consistency underscores the reliability and validity of our comparative evaluation, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of various embedding techniques for sentiment analysis on data.

## Results

In order to visually demonstrate the performance of each embedding technique, we present four graphs showcasing their respective accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These graphical representations offer a concise overview of the comparative evaluation results, facilitating clear interpretation and analysis of the findings.

## Conclusion

Our research highlights the importance of word embedding techniques in sentiment analysis tasks, with BERT showing superior accuracy and FastText and Word2Vec excelling in recall. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in sentiment analysis, with implications for understanding public opinion on social media platforms.
